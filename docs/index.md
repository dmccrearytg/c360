# Welcome to the TigerGraph Customer 360 CoPilot Demo

The purpose of this website is to create resources to explain how
CoPilot works and to show demonstrations of how you can ask
questions in plain English to a chatbot that answers the most
common questions in a Customer 360 situation.

We created a simple synthetic database of a website that
allows you to order products.  The database includes
lists of customers, orders, products and geospatial vertices.

We designed the database to be simple for people to quickly understand
the data but complex enough to show how CoPilot works on sample customer
data.
