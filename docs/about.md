# About the Customer 360 Copilot Demo

The goal of this site is to demonstrate how CoPilot works on a sample web storefront dataset. 
There are many benefits to combining large-language models (LLMs) work with graph databases.

Here are just some of the key benefits of combining LLMs and graph databases.

## Mapping Questions to Graph Queries (TigerGraph InquaryAI)

LLMs can translate complex natural language questions into graph database queries. This helps users access information intuitively without requiring in-depth technical knowledge, allowing them to interact with graph data structures efficiently.

## Mapping Questions to Document Sections (TigerGraph SupportAI)
Generative AI can identify relevant sections within large documents that relate to a user's question, streamlining the information retrieval process. This capability enhances the ability to navigate extensive datasets and extract specific insights without manual searching.

## Enhanced Knowledge Representation through Concepts in Taxonomies and Ontologies

Integrating taxonomies and ontologies with graph databases allows LLMs to understand domain-specific relationships, improving the accuracy of results. This structured knowledge aids LLMs in comprehending context and ensures that the generated content remains truthful and logically coherent.

## Improved Data Connectivity and Context

Graph databases excel at representing interconnected data. By mapping LLM outputs to graph structures, relationships between entities become clearer, leading to a more holistic view of the information. This contextual understanding enhances the relevance and coherence of generative outputs.

## Reduced Ambiguity and Increased Accuracy

Taxonomies and ontologies provide a structured framework that reduces ambiguity in responses. This structure allows generative AI to focus on specific entities and relationships, resulting in answers that are more precise and aligned with domain-specific knowledge.

## Customizable and Domain-Specific Applications

Combining LLMs with graph databases enables the creation of tailored applications, where specific ontologies define the context and relationships. This customization allows for domain-specific responses and insights, catering to particular industry or research needs.
